## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

### Removals

- `MachinesByCreationTimestamp` type has been removed.
- `ClusterCacheReconciler.Log` has been removed. Use the logger from the context instead.

### API Changes

### Other

- e2e tests are upgraded to use Ginkgo v2 (v2.1.4) and Gomega v1.20.0. Providers who use the test framework from this release will also need to upgrade, because Ginkgo v2 can't be imported alongside v1. Please see the [Ginkgo upgrade guide](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2), and note:
  * the default test timeout has been [changed to 1h](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2#timeout-behavior)
  * the `--junit-report` argument [replaces JUnit custom reporter](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2#improved-reporting-infrastructure) code
  * see the ["Update tests to Ginkgo v2" PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/6906) for a reference example
